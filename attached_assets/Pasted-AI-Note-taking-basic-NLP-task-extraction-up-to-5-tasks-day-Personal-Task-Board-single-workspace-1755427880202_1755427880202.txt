Opened server/services/ai-service.ts

Opened shared/schema.ts

Opened server/storage.ts
I'll implement all the premium features systematically. First, let me enhance the AI service with comprehensive task extraction, time estimation, and priority analysis features:

Optimized Agent memory
Let me add the missing storage methods to support all premium features:

Let me view the storage file to see the exact structure:


Opened server/storage.ts
Now I'll properly add the missing storage interface methods:

Now I need to import the missing types in the storage file and fix some other TypeScript errors:

I'll view the top of the storage file to see the exact import structure and fix it:


Opened server/storage.ts
Let me add the missing imports to the storage file:


Edited server/storage.ts
